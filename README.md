#### Cake-Splitting Algorithm ####
Splitting a cake fairly between two people is easy - one person splits the cake and the other person picks a piece.  That way each of them are convinced that they received at least 1/2 of the cake.  What about splitting a cake fairly between 3 people?  4 people?  5 people?  [Click here](/cakesplit.md) to see my solution.

#### Busy-waiting Code Snippet ####
Often it is useful to run some function that tries to do something, then run a check to see if it was done, and if not, try again and continue trying until a given time interval elapses. [These functions](https://gist.github.com/ddickstein/5986448) can help.
