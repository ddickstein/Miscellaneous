A collection of miscellaneous programs, algorithms, and thoughts.


#### Cake-Splitting Algorithm ####
Splitting a cake fairly between two people is easy - one person splits the cake and the other person picks a piece.  That way each of them are convinced that they received at least 1/2 of the cake.  What about splitting a cake fairly between 3 people?  4 people?  5 people?  [Click here](/cakesplit.md) to see my solution.

#### Combinator Utility ####
One of the greatest challenges that any college student faces is choosing classes.  All the courses look amazing, but you have requirements to fill, classes have scheduling conflicts, subsets of courses from which you only want to take one or two, etc.  Sometimes we find ourselves faced with decisions like these, where we have a large set of options, but an equally large set of constraints.  [This tool](/combinator) is designed to whittle down the possibilities so you can clearly see which possible combinations remain after all the constraints have been satisfied.

#### Busy-Waiting Code Snippet ####
Often it is useful to run some function that tries to do something, then run a check to see if it was done, and if not, try again and continue trying until a given time interval elapses. [These functions](https://gist.github.com/ddickstein/5986448) can help.
