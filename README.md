#### Cake-Splitting Algorithm ####
Splitting a cake fairly between two people is easy - one person splits the cake and the other person picks a piece.  That way each of them are convinced that they received at least 1/2 of the cake.  What about splitting a cake fairly between 3 people?  4 people?  5 people?  [Click here](/ddickstein/Miscellaneous/blob/master/cakesplit.md) to see my solution.
